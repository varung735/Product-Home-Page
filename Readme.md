## About Project

It's a home page of some shopping website which is featuring a headphone and it's huge discount on it. As you can see, it also conveying the features of the featured product (i.e. Headphone) for attracting the customers. 

## Concepts Used

 - Flex display property for mostly aligning divs.
 - positioning used for aligning that price sticker
